<h3>Live Demo : https://prajwal108.github.io/Analog_Clock_Javascript/

   This is an Analog Clock application built using JavaScript and HTML/CSS. It uses the current time to rotate clock hands and display the time on an HTML page. The code gets the elements from the HTML page with their respective ids, creates an audio element and plays it at every second. It also displays the day, month and date on the HTML page. The rotation of each clock hand is calculated based on current time values (hours, minutes, seconds) and the style of each clock hand is then updated to rotate according to its calculated value. The audio element is played and day, month and date elements on HTML page are updated with values from days, months and Date objects respectively.
